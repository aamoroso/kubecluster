# This kustomization depends on the metallb kustomization.
# This is because we have a chicken-and-egg problem whereby the CRs in the]
# default-pool.yaml cannot be created before the metallb resources are created
# The solution is to create a second Kustomization for the MetalLB CRs,
# and make it depend on the first Kustomization (MetalLB itself).
# I got this idea from https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/loadbalancer/metallb/#kustomization-for-crs-config
