# Overview

Rook turns distributed storage systems into self-managing, self-scaling, self-healing storage services. It automates the tasks of a storage administrator: deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.

Rook uses the power of the Kubernetes platform to deliver its services via a Kubernetes Operator for Ceph.
